      Currently I am more intrigued by web development and in a phase of learning new scripting languages and interesting frameworks. 
      I might pursue my career in web development sector however yet I am not completely sure whether I would like to introduce myself as a front-end or a back-end developer.  </b></div> </td>

                        <p style="color: white;">I was first introduced to java during my second semester.I found it to be quite similar to c++ but didn't really get to explore the depths of the language because it was a short semester. But I'm familiar with the concept of the object oriented programming that java envelopes, as I had to do a console application project with it. I might explore java more, if I get the chance to work with it again in the future.</p>

                            This is the first programming Language I learned and hence I am yet the most comfortable with this language. With "comfortable" I mean, I prefer this language the most when I am given a problem to solve. I possess a moderate knowledge on Object Oriented Programming concepts in C++ . Although most of the programming I did in my life is in this language, I have almost no visual project to showcase on this language. But I solved all my Data-Structure and Algorithm problems using c++.</p>

                        <p style="color: white;">I quite enjoyed this language while I was learning, though I did not choose this language out of interest but took it since it was in my university course curriculum. In this language, I was encouraged to work on Graphical User Interface for the first time. I learned some .NET frameworks throughout my course and completed a "Point of Sales" project. After completion of my course, I have not quite dug deeper into C#, but I really look forward to it.

                        <p style="color: white;" >I am Galib Shaikh Allahma currently studying at a reputed university in Bangladesh. Currently, I am on my way to complete my undergrad in computer science and engineering. Here, basically I am gaining knowledge about higher mathematics, electrical circuits, and components alongside computer science, networking, and numerous programming languages. Although I have gone through many different programming languages learned about different development sectors, the Web development sector pulled my interest into it. I am currently completing my 6th semester and besides my academics I'm trying to explore more about the Web and its development scopes. I would like to see myself as a Web developer in the near future and have dreams of becoming a part of something big. <span>]
